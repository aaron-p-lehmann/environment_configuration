# environment_configuration
My preferred shell configuration

I've put this here so I can copy it down when I change computers.  I'll try and keep it up to date as I change things that I like.  If you're not me, feel free to fork, but it's really unlikely I'll pay much attention to any PRs.  It's not for you, after all.

You'll need to remember to remap Capslock to Control.

# Contains
* .vimrc - Stolen mostly from a coworker.  I don't really like it, but I've been too lazy to iron out the bugs
* .tmux.conf - tmux config that makes pane switching and managment feel like vim and not like Emacs
