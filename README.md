# environment_configuration
My preferred shell configuration

I've put this here so I can copy it down when I change computers.  I'll try and keep it up to date as I change things that I like.  Feel free to make a PR if you think you've got a good idea.

You'll need to remember to remap Capslock to Control.

# Contains
* .vimrc - Stolen mostly from a coworker.  I don't really like it, but I've been too lazy to iron out the bugs
* .tmux.conf - tmux config that makes pane switching and managment feel like vim and not like Emacs
